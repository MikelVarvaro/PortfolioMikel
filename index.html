            <h2>Story & Skills</h2>
            <p>
                In 2019, I became a part of Georgian College and got introduced to the esports club by a classmate. Initially a participant, I soon saw its potential for student growth and learning. In early 2020, I became president of the Cyber Grizzlies Esports Club. Despite pandemic challenges, I united the fragmented club by devising innovative engagement strategies. This experience honed my Team Leadership, Management, and versatile skills. Today, the club is the largest in Georgian, earning the Changemaking Club 22/23 Award from the GCSA and creating a dozen new part-time jobs for full-time students.

                <h3>Team Leader</h3>
                <p>
                    Team Leadership was the most important skill it applied to everything I did as president. 
                    I learned very quickly how to be a good, understanding, firm, unshakable team leader after managing my first Esports Teams 
                    I learned other skills such as: reading people and how well they will work together. To be upfront and honest.

                <h3>Management</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether it was directly managing teams managing departments planning out structure, by strong and
                    clear communication and being able to keep what every I was tasked with in check as well as always 
                    looking to improve them, all of these aspects of the club taught me how to be an exemplary manager.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
                <p>
                    This is what I consider to be the most important skill, Critical Thinking,
                    in other words, to seek out improvement seek criticism to improve and better your self and have an open mind 
                    and considerate of other options.
